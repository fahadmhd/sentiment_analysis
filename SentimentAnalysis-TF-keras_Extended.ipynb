      "Text: An elegant and sophisticated Blanc de Blanc Champagne that delivers citrus and brioche notes with high laser acidity. It’s distinguished from other sparkling wines by its 7g/L dosage, harvested in 2015, and disgorged in November 2021. Pale yellow color. The nose and palate develop notes of white peach, lemon, apple, pear, biscuit, brioche, nutty, smoke, and wet stone. Brut, medium body, high laser acidity, medium alcohol (12.5%), multi-flavored, long finish, high complexity. Can be enjoyed now but also has potential for aging.\n",
